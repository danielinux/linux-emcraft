This module allows the user to join and leave IGMP multicast groups. Currently only IGMP2 is supported.


\subsection{pico\_igmp2\_join\_group}

\subsubsection*{Description}
Join an IGMP2 multicast group.

\subsubsection*{Function prototype}
\begin{verbatim}
int pico_igmp2_join_group(struct pico_ip4 *group_address,
struct pico_ipv4_link *link);
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \texttt{group\_address} - the address of the multicast group you want to join.
\item \texttt{link} - the link on which that multicast group should be joined.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Errors}
In case of failure, -1 is returned, and the value of pico$\_$err
is set as follows:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \texttt{PICO$\_$ERR$\_$EINVAL}          - Invalid argument provided
\item \texttt{PICO$\_$ERR$\_$EFAULT}          - Internal error
\item \texttt{PICO$\_$ERR$\_$EEXIST}          - Attempted to join a group that was already joined before
\end{itemize}

\subsection{pico\_igmp2\_leave\_group}

\subsubsection*{Description}
leave an IGMP2 multicast group.

\subsubsection*{Function prototype}
\texttt{int pico\_igmp2\_leave\_group(struct pico\_ip4 *group\_address, struct pico\_ipv4\_link *link);}

\subsubsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \texttt{group\_address} - the address of the multicast group you want to leave.
\item \texttt{link} - the link on which that multicast group should be left.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Return value}
In case of success, 0. In case of failure, -1 is returned and pico$\_$err is set accordingly.

\subsubsection*{Errors}
In case of success, zero is returned. In case of failure, -1 is returned, and the value of pico$\_$err
is set as follows:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \texttt{PICO$\_$ERR$\_$EINVAL}          - Invalid argument provided
\item \texttt{PICO$\_$ERR$\_$EFAULT}          - Internal error
\item \texttt{PICO$\_$ERR$\_$ENOENT}          - Attempted to leave a group which has never been joined
